Thank you. As of right now there is not much here to see, but it will expand as time goes on.

The scripts in this GitHub wont cause any damage. Meaning it wont do any harm to your computer they are simple scripts.

1. Useless Button.py [Even though it is useless it was my first script]
2. Fully working Random Number Generator [Generates a really long Number]
3. "SUPRISE" [This button now does something it will show you an image when clicked. Will keep the original Useless Button.]
4. Find Your local IP [I Wont track your IP this will simply show you your own IP]
5. My GITHUB page. [Takes you to my github]


Thank You!!
