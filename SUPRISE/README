COPYRIGHT NINTENDO OF AMERICA @2024
The picture of Donkey Kong is just there as an example for my work. 
All Nintendo character belong to their original owner.

In order for this to run you will need pillow module for python.
  you can install using this 
  'pip install pillow'

Once installed make sure the picture of DK is in the same folder as the script. 
If the name is changed it will not work. Trust me it was a huge headache trying to figure this out
but in the end i managed. And that should be it. Make sure your up to date on python

Thank you all for supporting me :D
