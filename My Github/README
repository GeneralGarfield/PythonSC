Hello everyone hope you guys are having a good day. I made a link to my github in my python script.
so now when you clink on the button it will take you to my github. Pretty cool

In order for this .py script to run you will need pillow installed.
Run this script to install in windows

  'PIP install pillow'

And make sure the image is in the same folder as the script or it will not run. Thank you guys. I feel like i've imporved over
these last couple of days working on scripts. And hopefully i will be able to create something that everyone will use.
Thank you all
